I have been a competitive cyclist for about 3 years. I currently ride track bikes and own a Specialized Langster. I mainly ride fixed gear/track bikes because it is way more fun to ride then just a normal freewheel bike. On this page I will tell you what is a fixed gear/track bike and tell you what to buy to get you to start riding.</p>  \r\n\r\n### Baseball background by Dylan:\r\n<p>Hi, I'm Dylan.
